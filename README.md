# ds_implementation
Library for linked lists and trees

Plan of attack

per ds =>
define functions that are needed for linked lists
split into two groups (label A and B functions)
break into pairs, pair A takes A fns and B takes B fns
each group builds out testing suite for their fns
  see reference to syntax: http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/
each group builds out methods for their fns
each group reviews the other groups code

switch groups, move to next ds
